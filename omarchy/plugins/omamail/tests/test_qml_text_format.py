"""Every Text that shows something a stranger wrote must say it is plain.

Qt's default is Text.AutoText, which runs Qt.mightBeRichText() over the string
and switches to the rich text engine when it finds something tag-shaped. That
engine fetches <img src="https://..."> for real — so a subject line, a sender
name, or a snippet carrying one becomes exactly the tracking beacon the message
body is stripped of, without the body ever being opened.

The reader's own TextEdit is the one deliberate exception: it renders a
document that Html.sanitize has already been through.
