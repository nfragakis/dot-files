# The order an IMAP conversation reaches the server in, checked against a real
# curl and a real server.
#
# A Coremail server — 163.com and the mailboxes around it — answers every
# SELECT with "Unsafe Login" until the client has sent the RFC 2971 ID command.
# curl gives that refusal the same exit code as a denied login, so the mailbox
# reported a perfectly good password as wrong and loaded nothing.
#
# Getting ID in front of the SELECT is harder than it sounds, and the three
# facts below are why the transport has an `imap-id` mode rather than one more
# command in the ordinary one:
#
#   1. curl opens the URL's path itself, before the first command it was given,
#      so nothing can be placed in front of that SELECT.
#   2. Dropping the path wins the order and loses the answer: curl then hands
#      the reply to a different channel than the one the transport reads, which
#      is silent — exit 0, no error, an empty mailbox.
#   3. A server that has never heard of ID answers BAD, and curl runs with
#      --fail-early, so one BAD takes every command after it. Hence the
#      capability gate rather than sending it to everyone.
