// The stubbed transport, read back from the client that made a request.
//
// Under `tests/qml/imports` a `Process` is an `Item` that never exits on its
// own, so every request a JMAP client makes lands among its children and
// stays there until a test answers it. These are the four questions every
// such test asks: which processes the client holds, which are new since a
// moment ago, what one of them asked for, and how to answer it.

// Every transport process the client holds. `requestLine` is the property
// only a transport carries.
