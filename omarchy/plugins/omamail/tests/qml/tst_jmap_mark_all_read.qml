// "Mark these read" reaches the rail and the open message, and comes back.
//
// The list's rows took the change and the rail's stops did not: every member
// summary the account held kept its dot, and nothing later re-reads a member
// it already has, so the stale dot lasted the session. The same batch now
// marks every held member, gives a representative its row's own recomputed
// summary, and reads the open message the same way — and an error puts all
// three back with the rows.
//
// Why Qt rather than node: the batch is one function over four properties of
// one account, and the failure this is written against was the function
// touching three of them. The account is a real `MailAccount` on the real
// `JmapClient`; its transport is the stubbed `Process` under
// `tests/qml/imports`, which never exits on its own, so the request stays in
// flight until this test ends it.
