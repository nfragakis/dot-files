# Omamail — a Gmail and IMAP email client for Omarchy

**Your mail as a native Omarchy window — not a browser tab.**

Omamail is an Omarchy desktop email client: a Quickshell plugin that reads,
triages, and answers your mail over the official Gmail API, or over IMAP and
SMTP for every other mailbox. It runs inside the `omarchy-shell` process you
already have, follows your active theme, and puts an unread count in the bar.

Works with **Gmail**, **Fastmail**, **iCloud Mail**, **Outlook**, **Yahoo**,
**Zoho**, **GMX**, **Proton Mail** (through its Bridge), and any other IMAP
server — including one you run yourself.

## Features

- **Designed, not assembled.** Monospace, square-cornered, and built to sit
  inside Omarchy rather than to look like a web app in a window. Three columns
  when there is room, one when there is not, and nothing on screen that is not
  your mail.
- **Gmail and IMAP.** Sign in to Gmail with Google directly, or add any IMAP
  mailbox with an address and an app password. Several accounts at once, each
  with its own inbox, cache and unread count.
- **Keyboard-first.** `j`/`k` to move, `e` to archive, `s` to star, `r` to
  reply, `c` to compose, `Alt+1`…`0` for the mailboxes — hold Alt and the rail says
  which is which — `Alt+A` to switch account, `/` to search, `?` for the rest.
- **Always counting.** The unread badge keeps working while the window is shut,
  for every account, with a desktop notification when new mail lands.
- **One window.** Read, archive, star, trash, search, and answer without a
  second window taking a region of its own.
- **Invitations you can answer.** A meeting invitation is read out of the
  message's own calendar part and drawn as a meeting: when it runs, in your
  clock rather than the organiser's, how long for, where, whether it repeats,
  and who else has said yes. **Yes**, **Maybe** and **No** answer the
  organiser, and a Google Meet link joins in one click. It works on every
  mailbox here, not only Gmail — the answer is an ordinary reply, which is
  what every calendar server is already listening for.
- **Off a list in one click.** A newsletter that supports one-click
  unsubscribing is unsubscribed from without leaving the window. One that only
  offers an address gets a message; one that only offers a page says so before
  it opens your browser. Nothing is ever fetched from a sender's address until
  you ask.
- **Images stay blocked.** Loading a sender's pictures tells them the mail was
  read, from which address and when. They load when you ask, for that one
  message.
- **Your theme.** Every colour comes from the active Omarchy theme, so the
  mailbox changes the moment the desktop does.
- **Keyring-backed.** The Gmail refresh token and every IMAP password live in
  GNOME Keyring — never in a config file, never on a command line.

## What it is

Three parts, one plugin:

- an **unread badge** in the bar, which keeps counting whether or not the
  window is open
- an **application window** — a real Hyprland window, tiled like any other,
  with your mailboxes, the message list, and the reader side by side
- **compose and reply inside that same window**, because a second window would
  take a region of its own under Omarchy's panel mechanism

## Add it to Omarchy

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/huacnlee/omamail.git --enable
```

Then click the envelope in the bar. To open it from the keyboard, add this to
`~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
  o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + G", "Omamail", "omarchy shell shell toggle omamail '{}'")
```

The target is `shell`, not the plugin id: the window is summoned by the shell,
which is what loads it in the first place. A plugin-scoped target would have to
be registered by code that is only running once the window is already open.

Requires Omarchy 4, plus `socat`, `secret-tool`, `openssl`, `xdg-open` and
`curl` — all of which Omarchy already ships.

This custom checkout also integrates with Evolution Data Server when it is
installed. A matching Evolution Google account supplies short-lived access
tokens through EDS's supported API; Evolution keeps and refreshes the grant.
The setup page offers the accounts Evolution already knows, so connecting one
is a single click with no OAuth client involved. `docs/EVOLUTION.md` covers how
that works, moving accounts between machines, and the one trap left — a running
shell overwrites a hand-edited account list.

## Mailboxes it can open

Adding a mailbox asks which kind first, because the two setups have nothing in
common.

**Gmail** uses a matching Evolution Data Server Google account when one exists.
Otherwise it signs in with Google directly using an OAuth client you create
once. Either route gets labels, conversations, Gmail's own search syntax, and a
"report spam" that Google actually learns from.

**IMAP** is an address and a password. Fastmail, iCloud, Zoho, Outlook, GMX,
Proton via its Bridge, or a server of your own: the servers are filled in from
the address for the ones this knows, and shown behind a disclosure so they can
be corrected for the ones it does not. Most providers want an *app password*
rather than the one you sign in to their website with, and the form says so
before you find out the hard way.

What IMAP does not have, the panel does not offer: no labels, no server-side
conversations, no "report spam" — moving a message to a Junk folder teaches a
server nothing, and a button that quietly meant that would be a promise this
could not keep. Archive appears only when the server has an archive folder to
move to. Sending goes out over SMTP, or the mailbox is read-only if no SMTP
server is set.

**HEY** is listed as a future integration. A HEY CLI is reportedly in
development; once it is ready, Omamail can support it through the provider seam
that is already in place.

To remove it:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove omamail
```

That takes the plugin itself. Nothing it wrote lives inside your Omarchy
config, so removing those is separate and entirely up to you:

```bash
secret-tool clear service omamail    # the refresh token and IMAP passwords
rm -rf ~/.config/omamail             # the OAuth client and account list
rm -rf ~/.cache/omamail              # cached mail
```

Signing out from inside the app clears the keyring entry on its own. The plugin
never edits your shell, Hyprland or theme configuration — the one keybinding
above is yours to add and yours to remove.

## Connecting your mailbox

On this custom build, Evolution Data Server is the first choice. Omamail asks
EDS for a live access token by account address; EDS refreshes it through
Evolution's verified Google client. Omamail never receives or stores the EDS
refresh token. The Google Cloud setup below remains a fallback for accounts EDS
does not know.

Gmail has no shared application to sign in through. Google issues API access
per Cloud project, so Omamail signs in with an OAuth client **you own**.
The window walks you through it in five steps, each with the console page one
click away. It takes about two minutes, once.

The step people skip, and the one that decides whether the sign-in lasts:
**press "Publish app"** on your own project. A project left in Testing is
issued refresh tokens that expire after seven days, so the app would sign you
out every week. Publishing shows an "unverified app" warning once — expected
for a client you made yourself, since you are the developer and the only user.

If you have the `gcloud` CLI, `scripts/google-cloud-setup.sh` does the two
steps that have an API — creating the project and enabling Gmail — and opens
the console on the rest with the project already selected. The consent screen
and the client itself are console-only; there is no CLI for them.

> **Why isn't a client built in?** `gmail.modify` and `gmail.send` are
> *restricted* scopes. Shipping a client would mean this project completing
> Google's OAuth verification first; until then it would be stuck in Testing,
> handing every user a seven-day session. The code is ready for one —
> `Credentials.BUILTIN` is a single constant — and your own client always wins
> over it.

## Using it

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` | Move down / up |
| `Enter` or `o` | Open the selected message |
| `Esc` | Back out of the current message, search, draft, or settings page |
| `e` | Archive |
| `d` | Move to trash |
| `s` | Star or unstar |
| `Shift+I` / `u` or `Shift+U` | Mark read / unread |
| `r` / `a` / `f` | Reply, reply all, forward |
| `c` | Compose |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Send |
| `/` or `Ctrl+K` | Search |
| `Alt+1` … `Alt+0` | The mailbox with that number on the rail |
| `Ctrl+U` | Show unread mail for the current account |
| `Alt+A` | Switch account |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous account |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Scroll an open message down / up |
| `l` | Open the first safe web link in an open message |
| `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0` | Zoom the message body, or reset it |
| `F5` | Check for mail |
| `Ctrl+?` | Every shortcut |

Search takes Gmail's own operator syntax straight through — `from:jane`,
`has:attachment`, `older_than:7d`. Unread follows the same inbox scope as the
account. Category tabs do not remove the `INBOX` label, so personal Gmail
accounts can use `in:inbox category:primary`; a Workspace mailbox without tabs
can carry an `inboxQuery` override of `in:inbox` in `accounts.json`. Right-click
any row in the list for archive,
trash, spam, star and read/unread without leaving the keyboard cursor behind.

## What it does not do

- **No embedded browser.** Message bodies render through Qt's own rich text
  engine, which handles the HTML-4-and-inline-styles subset that real mail is
  written in. A browser engine cannot be embedded in a plugin at all:
  `QtWebEngineQuick::initialize()` has to run before the host process builds
  its `QGuiApplication`, and a plugin loads long after that.
- **No attachment downloads.** Not yet.

Remote images in a message body are blocked until you ask for them, and asking
covers that one message. Qt really does fetch an `<img src="https://…">`, so
loading a message's pictures fires whatever tracking pixels it carries and tells
the sender when the mail was read — which is why it is a decision rather than a
default. Images pointed at this machine or at the network around it (loopback,
private addresses, `.local` names, `file:`) are never fetched at all, however
often you ask: a message must not be able to make the client knock on the door
of something listening on your own network.

Several mailboxes can be added and switched between; each keeps its own cache,
its own refresh token, and its own unread count, and the bar badge counts all of
them. They share one OAuth client, since a client belongs to a Cloud project
rather than to an address — so adding a second mailbox is a sign-in, not another
trip through the console. Mailboxes are added and removed on the settings page,
and switched from the menu, the user bar at the foot of the rail, or `Alt+A` —
which opens the same switcher with the keyboard on the mailbox you are in:
`j`/`k` move, `Enter` or `o` takes one.

The message list, labels and profile are cached per account so switching never
waits on the network. Message bodies are cached one file per message — a
thousand of them, evicted least-recently-used.

## Where your credentials live

- With Evolution Data Server, the refresh grant remains entirely under EDS's
  ownership. Omamail receives only a short-lived access token over a local pipe.
- With the fallback OAuth client, the refresh token goes to **GNOME Keyring**,
  keyed by client *and* account, and the client goes to
  `~/.config/omamail/credentials.json` with mode `0600`.
- The access token exists only in memory.
- Signing out clears the keyring entry.

The fallback asks for `gmail.modify` and `gmail.send`. Evolution's broker grants
its broader `mail.google.com` scope, but Omamail's own operations remain limited
to reading, labelling, archiving, sending, and moving messages to trash; it has
no permanent-delete operation.

## Development

```bash
./install.sh          # symlink this checkout into ~/.config/omarchy/plugins
