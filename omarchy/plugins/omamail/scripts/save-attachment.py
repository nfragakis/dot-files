"""Decode one mail attachment and keep it, rather than opening it once.

Same two lines on stdin as open-attachment.py — the filename and the data,
both base64 — because they come from the same place and the QML side should
not have to know which of the two it is talking to.

Where it lands is the desktop's own answer, read from the environment and then
from user-dirs.dirs rather than by running xdg-user-dir: the binary belongs to
a package that is not everywhere, and the file it reads is a shell fragment
with two lines worth parsing.

The final path goes to stdout so the panel can say where the file went. A
message that names no location is a message that sends the reader to look.
