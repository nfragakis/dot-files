#!/bin/sh
# Runs one IMAP conversation, or sends one message over SMTP, and hands the
# result back to the panel.
#
# curl is the client. It owns TLS, LOGIN, the tagged command it wraps each
# request in, and the literals in the reply; `Imap.js` owns every string that
# goes in and every decision about what comes back. Nothing in between needs a
# library the plugin would have to carry.
#
# ## Everything crosses on stdin, base64-encoded
#
# One line, fields separated by spaces:
#
#   imap <b64 url> <b64 user:password> <b64 command> [<b64 command> ...]
#   imap-id <b64 root url> <b64 url> <b64 user:password> <b64 preamble> <b64 command> ...
#   imap-append <b64 url> <b64 user:password> <b64 message> <b64 flags>
#   smtp <b64 url> <b64 user:password> <b64 from> <b64 message> <b64 rcpt> ...
#   *-oauth uses <b64 username> <b64 bearer token> in place of <b64 user:password>
#
# base64 rather than the values themselves, for three reasons that each bite
# once during this script's life:
#
#   - a password never reaches the process table, which is the same rule
#     keyring-store.sh follows for the refresh token
#   - a password, a folder name and an IMAP command may all contain quotes,
#     backslashes and spaces; base64 has none of those, so the field split is a
#     plain `set --` and there is no escaping to get wrong
#   - the fields arrive on one line, because Quickshell's Process.write() never
#     closes stdin and anything reading to EOF would hang forever
#
# ## And comes back base64-encoded
#
#   <curl exit code>
#   <b64 stdout>
#   <b64 stderr>
#
# The response is base64 for a different reason: IMAP measures a literal in
# octets, so the parser has to count octets. Base64 keeps the byte count exact
# across a pipe the shell would otherwise read as text, keeps binary attachment
# data intact, and guarantees no newline inside a response can be mistaken for
# the end of one.
