// JMAP's own rules, and nothing else. No transport lives here —
// `scripts/jmap-transport.sh` runs the curl process and `JmapClient.qml` owns
// it — and no MIME parsing either: an RFC 822 message is `Message.js`'s
// subject, and this file never sees one. What it does own is the other
// direction, `toMessage`: a JMAP Email *composed* into the shared message
// resource, the way `HeyClient.toMessage` composes rather than parses.
//
// This is the JMAP seam and the one place a rule about JMAP goes, with one job
// beside it: `JmapThreads.js` holds the collapsed list read — the four chained
// calls a page of conversations is, the rule about which members a row counts,
// and the block a row draws from. `Jmap.js` is the provider *description* the
// registry reads — a name, a ceiling, the rail's rows — and holds no protocol.
// The client imports this file as `Jmap`, which is the name every call in it
// is read under: `Jmap.parseQuery`, `Jmap.toMessage`, `Jmap.refusals`.
//
// What this file owns is every decision about what came back, which is what
// the node tests reach without a compositor or a mailbox.
//
// ## Three levels of failure, and they are not the same question
//
// JMAP fails in three places and a client that flattened them would report the
// wrong thing at least a third of the time:
//
//   - the *transport*: curl never connected, or the server answered with a
//     status. `transportError` turns a curl exit and an HTTP status into a
//     sentence.
//   - the *request*: the server read the JSON and refused the whole document —
//     an unknown capability, a size limit. `requestError` reads the
//     problem-details object those come back as.
//   - the *method*: the document was accepted and one invocation inside it
//     answered `error`. `methodError` reads the first of those, unless the
//     caller was expecting that type and has a branch for it.
//
// Every sentence is written for somebody who just clicked Archive rather than
// for somebody reading a server log, and anything that could carry a
// credential passes through `redact` before it can reach a label.

// The ceiling on a blob download, fixed in the transport script as well: the
// same figure `attachment.sh` will send up to. Exceeding it is curl exit 63
// rather than a 20 MB base64 line crossing a pipe.
var MAX_BLOB_BYTES = 20971520

// The three values the `authScheme` field may hold. The script builds the
// credential from one of these and refuses anything else, so QML never
// assembles an Authorization value of its own. `none` is discovery's
// well-known GET, on a URL the user did not type.

// References header.
//
// A send uploads and submits before a separate draft cleanup. The submission
// request carries, in order:
//
//   0. `Email/import` of the blob into the Drafts role's mailbox, with
//      `$draft` and `$seen`. `$seen` is what keeps Sent from showing an unread
//      message.
//   1. `EmailSubmission/set` creating from the import's *creation id*, with
//      the chosen identity and an `onSuccessUpdateEmail` that moves the copy
//      into Sent and clears `$draft`. Nothing appends to Sent by hand.
// The client removes an existing draft only after a successful response, since
// a failed method does not stop the remaining calls in a request.
//
// No `envelope`. The server derives the sender from the identity and the
// recipients from To, Cc and Bcc, strips Bcc on delivery and keeps it on the
// Sent copy — the same recipient set the IMAP client reads off the same
// headers, and one this client cannot disagree with.
