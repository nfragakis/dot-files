// A JMAP account's sign-in, which is an address and one secret.
//
// Same shape from outside as `ImapAuth` and `AuthManager`: `MailAccount` asks
// whether it is `loggedIn` and asks for a credential with one call whose
// callback takes `(value, error)`. What differs is what a credential *is*
// here. IMAP's is one `user:password` field because that is what curl wants;
// this one is three fields — a scheme, a username and a secret — because the
// transport script builds the `Authorization` value itself and QML must never
// assemble one.
//
// The secret is an app password or an API token, and which of the two it is
// decides the scheme. That is detected rather than asked: the client sends the
// session GET with Basic and, only on a 401, once more with Bearer, and the
// scheme that answered is recorded on the account. Nothing here refreshes and
// nothing expires — a 401 afterwards is a credential that was revoked, which
// is the setup page's problem rather than a retry.
//
// Where the secret lives is the same rule as every other credential in this
// plugin: GNOME Keyring, written over stdin so it never reaches the process
// table, keyed by account so two mailboxes cannot overwrite each other.
