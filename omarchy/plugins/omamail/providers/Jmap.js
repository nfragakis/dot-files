// What a JMAP mailbox is, as far as the panel is concerned.
//
// The protocol itself is `JmapProtocol.js` and the transport is
// `scripts/jmap-transport.sh` under `JmapClient.qml`. This file answers the
// same four questions `Registry.js` asks of every provider, and the answers
// differ from IMAP's in ways the panel has to respect rather than paper over:
// JMAP has a server-side thread id, a junk verb some servers really do learn
// from, and one query language for the whole account rather than a selected
// folder.

var ID = "jmap"
var NAME = "JMAP"

// One line, on the provider chooser. It names no service on purpose — the
// same instruction the setup page follows. A JMAP server is Stalwart today and
// something else next year, and a chooser that listed two of them would be
// wrong about the third.
var SUMMARY = "Any server that speaks JMAP"

// An app password or an API token, typed into a field. Which of the two it is
// decides the auth scheme, and the scheme is detected rather than asked:
// `Protocol.AUTH_SCHEME_ORDER` is Basic then Bearer.
var AUTH = "password"

// No mark and no logo. There is no JMAP brand to draw — it is a protocol, not
// a service — so a mailbox here gets the themed envelope, as IMAP does.

// The ceiling, not the guarantee. An account may refuse one of these from what
// its own session and mailbox list say — `JmapProtocol.refusals` — and nothing
// may add one back.
var CAPABILITIES = {
  // A message is in one mailbox, near enough. Both reference servers put it
  // there, and the label strip was built for Gmail's several-at-once.
  labels: false,
  // `Email.threadId` is the server's own, so threading is a fact rather than a
  // References guess.
  threads: true,
  // And a row can therefore be one conversation rather than one message.
  conversations: true,
  // Only if the account has somewhere to put it, which the client decides per
  // account from the mailbox roles it resolved.
  archive: true,
  // Unlike IMAP: a move into Junk is a verb the server acts on where the
  // session proves the server learns from it. Where it does not, the account
  // refuses this rather than the provider giving it up for everybody.
  spam: true,
  // `$flagged`, mandatory in RFC 8621.
  star: true,
  // `Email/set` changes many ids in one round trip.
  batch: true,
  // The `text` filter condition, also mandatory.
  search: true,
  // Where the account has the submission capability, which sign-in reads and
  // an account without it refuses.
  send: true,
  // No web UI this plugin could know the address of. Stalwart ships no webmail
  // at all, and a verified address for one that does is a provider-level
  // decision somebody has to make with an account in front of them.

// Roles, not folder names and not queries. The `role:`, `mailbox:` and `text:`
// DSL is read by `JmapProtocol.parseQuery` and by nothing else — everywhere
// above, these strings are opaque, handed back to the client that produced
// them and used as a cache key.
//
// A role is what the rail is keyed on because it is the one stable name: the
// same row is "Junk" on one server and "Spam" on another, and RFC 8621's
// `role` is what both of them agree on. The client resolves each to a mailbox
// id per account — by role, then by the leaf-name guesses IMAP makes — and the
// three optional rows disappear on an account where that resolves to nothing.
//
// IMAP's eight rows, in IMAP's order. "Flagged" rather than "Starred": the
// keyword is `$flagged`, and the word a JMAP server's own interface uses is
// the one a user has already met. No "All mail" row — that is a Gmail idea,
// and a query across every mailbox is what search is for.
