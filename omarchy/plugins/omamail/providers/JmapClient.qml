// A JMAP mailbox, wearing the same interface `GmailApiClient` wears.
//
// The transport is `scripts/jmap-transport.sh`, which is curl. The protocol is
// `JmapProtocol.js`, with the collapsed list read in `JmapThreads.js`. This
// file is the part in between: which requests a given job becomes, in what
// order, and what to do when one of them fails.
//
// It signs the account in — discovery, the session GET under each scheme in
// turn, the four-step check — and it reads: the rail, the labels, the list, a
// page, a search, the counts, one message whole and the octets of a part. It
// writes, too: read, star, archive, trash, junk and their reverses, each one
// `Email/set` patch per message. It holds an event stream open for as long as
// the account is signed in, and reports what changes on it. And it sends: one
// upload of the raw message and one request that imports it, submits it under
// the chosen identity. A confirmed send then retires the original draft.
//
// ## Three things every read depends on, in this order
//
//   1. the *session*. Its API URL, its download template and its limits are
//      the server's answer rather than the account's settings, so it is held
//      in memory, kept in the account's cache file and refetched when neither
//      has one — or when a reply's `sessionState` says the one held has been
//      superseded. A restart has neither until this runs.
//   2. the *mailbox list*, read once on first need. Every query gates on it
//      the way IMAP's gates on LIST: a filter needs the mailbox id a role
//      resolved to, and so does every label id on every row.
//   3. the *role map* over that list, which is what a rail row means on this
//      account. Rebuilt whenever the list is replaced, and with it `refusals`
//      and `absentMailboxes` — the two answers that take a button, a key hint
//      and a rail row away before anything reaches the server.
